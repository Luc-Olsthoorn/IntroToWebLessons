## Welcome! This is the first lesson.

Today we will be getting our environment setup.

### Installs

#### Atom

You can use any environment you want, but I prefer atom!

(atom allows you to edit files)

https://atom.io/

#### Node/JS

We are going to be coding in js, and node js, so have npm installed, and node

(npm is a package manager -- pretty much lets us use other peoples code)

npmjs.com/get-npm

#### Docker

We are going to be installing docker for our deployments

https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/

https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/

#### Slack

Like any software company, we will be using slack to do a lot of our communication

### Assignment:

Build a simple webpage (just .html) and make a button that when you press it, it alerts HELLO.

This should be pretty straight forward, and can be accomplished with around 15 lines in a single .html. Do some research, part of learning to code is figuring out how to google.

#### Bonus:

If you can make it so it takes 10s to alert after the button first.

### Next Week:

Next week we will review this code, and extend it. We will then work on docker, git, and more javascript.

### Footnotes

I know it seems basic, but having these fundamentals will launch us into more complex things soon!
